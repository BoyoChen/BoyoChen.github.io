Boyo is currently working as a Research Assistant at National Taiwan University, Taipei. He broadly studies foundational topics in machine learning. His previous researches mainly focus on building up a reliable system for disaster management using computer vision techniques. He received his BS and MS in Computer Science from [National Taiwan University](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/main.php) in 2016 and 2018, respectively, advised by [Hsuan-Tien Lin](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~htlin/). Before leaving for ph.D., In 2019, he works at [Appier](https://www.appier.com/) for about one year to acquire experiences in the industry, where he developed a data-intensive API server, handling large-scale data with graphQL.

      <strong>The Differentiable Cross-Entropy Method</strong><br>

      <div id="abs_amos2020differentiable" style="text-align: justify; display: none" markdown="1">
        We study the Cross-Entropy Method (CEM) for the non-convex
        optimization of a continuous and parameterized
        objective function and introduce a differentiable
        variant (DCEM) that enables us to differentiate the
        output of CEM with respect to the objective
        function's parameters. In the machine learning
        setting this brings CEM inside of the end-to-end
        learning pipeline where this has otherwise been
        impossible. We show applications in a synthetic
        energy-based structured prediction task and in
        non-convex continuous control. In the control
        setting we show on the simulated cheetah and walker
        tasks that we can embed their optimal action
        sequences with DCEM and then use policy optimization
        to fine-tune components of the controller as a step
        towards combining model-based and model-free RL.
